This repository contains example PICO-8 code and prototypes.

## Zelda-like PICO-8 Demo

Open `zelda_like.p8` in the PICO-8 editor to play a small top-down demo. Use the arrow keys to move and Z to swing your sword.

## RuneLite PICO status

`runelite_pico.p8` is a more advanced cartridge under active development. The current build includes:

- Arrow key movement and click-to-move targeting
- HUD bars for health, mana and experience
- NPCs that open dialog when clicked
- Basic quests and an inventory panel
- Skill progression with experience gain
- Sword combat, wandering enemies that chase the player
- Simple fire and heal spells

Further features are planned in `todo.md`.
